The Dynamic Twitter Avatar
==========================

This script glitches my Twitter avatar and uploads it to Twitter. This means that while my avatar should always be recognizable, it's always changing.

The glitch bit is just from my trial and error. The OAuth bit from https://gist.github.com/hayesdavis/97756. It sometimes makes a file that isn't a valid jpg, and in those cases the Twitter endpoint just fails to process it.
